# Session : 7

## Objective

- Write a function using only list filter lambda that can tell whether a number is a Fibonacci number or not. You can use a pre-calculated list/dict to store fab numbers till 10000 PTS:100
- Using list comprehension (and zip/lambda/etc if required) write an expression that: PTS:100
  - add 2 iterables a and b such that a is even and b is odd
  - strips every vowel from a string provided (tsai>>t s)
  - acts like a ReLU function for a 1D array
  - acts like a sigmoid function for a 1D array
  - takes a small character string and shifts all characters by 5 (handle boundary conditions) tsai>>yxfn
- A list comprehension expression that takes a ~200 word paragraph, and checks whether it has any of the swear words mentioned in https://github.com/RobertJGabriel/Google-profanity-words/blob/master/list.txt PTS:200 (Links to an external site.)
- Using reduce function: PTS:100
  - add only even numbers in a list
  - find the biggest character in a string (printable ascii characters)
  - adds every 3rd number in a list
- Using randint, random.choice and list comprehensions, write an expression that generates 15 random KADDAADDDD number plates, where KA is fixed, D stands for a digit, and A stands for Capital alphabets. 10<<DD<<99 & 1000<<DDDD<<9999 PTS:100
- Write the above again from scratch where KA can be changed to DL, and 1000/9999 ranges can be provided. Now use a partial function such that 1000/9999 are hardcoded, but KA can be provided PTS:100

```
&nbsp;
- Write a test file, that tests all of the functions mentioned above + the other basic ones 
- Test file must contain at least 1 tests for each function
